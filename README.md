# converter
This is a simple and responsive converter application built using HTML and CSS. The project allows users to convert between different units (e.g., currency, length, weight, etc.) in a user-friendly interface. It features a clean layout, intuitive design, and responsive styling to ensure compatibility across various devices. This project demonstrates my ability to create functional and visually appealing web tools using HTML and CSS.
